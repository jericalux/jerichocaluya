                        <p> Hello! My name is <strong>Jericho Caluya</strong>, and welcome to my portfolio showcasing my personal work and future aspirations. 
                            Jumping into a little bit about myself, I'm currently a senior at San Diego State University studying Management Information
                            Systems with a passion to contribute to organizational success in the world of business. I was born and raised here in San Diego 
                            and couldn't ask for a better, all-around environmentâ€”from the weather to the amazing food choices, I've enjoyed every bit of it so far
                            and don't plan to move anytime soon. In my free time, I enjoy going to the gym, hanging out with friends, and exploring new places. I've
                            always been an outgoing and spontaneous person, and I enjoy looking into the unknown, always excited about what's to come.
                        </p>
                        <p>With a passion for <strong>the bridge between technology and business</strong>, I strive to create impactful projects that make a difference, 
                            and seek to leverage my skills while expanding my experience in optimizing processes, improving data-driven decision making, and contributing to society as a whole.
