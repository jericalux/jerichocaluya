            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p> Ever since I was little I've only ever been engaged with things related to space, technology, and gadgets. 
                I would build things, create different homemade inventions out of random crafts and supplies, 
                and always wondered what else was out there. Eventually, that carried onto my educational career where majority 
                of the classes I was taking was catered toward some sort of engineering path. That took a turn during my sophomore year however, 
                that after much thought and hard decisions, it occurred to me how I was more interested in the innerworkings of business 
                and how it's used and seen in our everyday lives. More specifically, the bridge between technology and business. 
                Prior to my switch in majors, I would binge the show, Shark Tank, and involve myself more with different types of 
                technology, computers, etc. I've always been a hands-on learner and love experiencing new things, and I feel like MIS 
                was a perfect swtich for me. Since then, I've had the opportunity to work on various projects that have honed my skills in 
                <strong>networking, database design, and programming</strong> and continue to seek opportunities for growth and learning.</p>

            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>Outside of my professional life, I enjoy:</p>
            <ul class="interest-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Music</strong>: Ranging from listening to many genres of music to playing the piano, I enjoy music as much as playing it. 
                    I feel like, to me, music can be utilized for a plethora of reasons to manage the emotions you feel throughout the day, connect you closer to people, 
                    and allow you to portray yourself openly.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Baseball</strong>: I've loved the game of baseball ever since I was a kid and have played during my younger years as a shortstop with a little league
                    team, all-star team, and travel team as well. Although baseball can get boring and slow sometimes, I feel like it gives you a tense and suspenseful feeling since
                    anything can happen, always keeping you on your feet.

                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cars</strong>: Growing up, I've always enjoyed cars as well. I grew up around a family whose passion for cars paved a way for me to not only gain an
                    interest but build and modify my own as well. My favorite part about building cars as a hobby is the challenge, as you never know what
                    you're getting into, you're never satisfied with the outcome, and always striving to do more.
